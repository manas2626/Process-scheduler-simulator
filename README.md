# Processor-Scheduling-Simulator
The simulator is used to schedule multiple processors.
A Process Scheduling Simulator is a tool designed to simulate and visualize how a CPU schedules processes using various scheduling algorithms. It provides a dynamic environment to demonstrate algorithms' functionality, efficiency, and differences, making it a useful educational and analytical tool for understanding process management in operating systems.

Key Features of a Process Scheduling Simulator:

	1.	Simulation of Algorithms:
	•	First-Come, First-Served (FCFS): Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.
	•	Shortest Job Next (SJN): The process with the shortest burst time is executed next.
	•	Priority Scheduling: Processes are scheduled based on priority values.
	•	Round-Robin (RR): Processes are scheduled in time slices, cycling through them.
	•	Multilevel Queue Scheduling: Processes are divided into queues with different scheduling policies.
	•	Multilevel Feedback Queue: Allows dynamic movement between queues based on behaviour.
	2.	Visualization:
	•	Gantt charts to represent the scheduling timeline.
	•	Process tables showing arrival, burst, completion, turnaround, and waiting times.
	3.	User Input Options:
	•	Add processes with parameters like arrival time, burst time, and priority.
	•	Configure time quantum for round-robin scheduling.
	4.	Performance Metrics:
	•	Average waiting time.
	•	Average turnaround time.
	•	CPU utilization and throughput.
	5.	Interactive Environment:
	•	Modify processes during runtime for dynamic analysis.
	•	Toggle between algorithms to compare performance.
	6.	Educational Benefits:
	•	Helps students and professionals understand CPU scheduling concepts.
	•	Demonstrates the impact of scheduling choices on system performance.

Applications:

	•	Teaching and learning in operating systems courses.
	•	Analyzing and comparing scheduling algorithms.
	•	Demonstrating real-world scenarios in CPU scheduling and process management.
